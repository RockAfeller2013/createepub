#Paul Graham's Essays in EPUB FORMAT

It's been on my to-do list to read [Paul Graham's](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html) essays, but since they're on a website and I prefer reading on my Kindle, I asked ChatGPT-5 to write a Python script to convert them. Then you can upload the resulting file to your Kindle. [upload to Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle)

python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python paulgraham_epub.py
source venv/bin/activate && python paulgraham_epub.py
